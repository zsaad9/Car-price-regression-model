# Predictive Pricing Model for Used Cars

Problem Statement:
The aim of this project was to develop a robust pricing model capable of accurately predicting the prices of used cars. The model's predictions will assist businesses in formulating effective pricing strategies, enabling them to optimize profits through differential pricing. Additionally, I seek to identify key factors influencing the prices of used cars through comprehensive data analysis.

Approach:
Using supervised machine learning techniques, particularly logistic regression, I developed a predictive model based on a dataset containing information about various attributes of used cars and their corresponding prices. Python served as the primary programming language for implementing the model and conducting data analysis.

Methodology:

Data Collection: Gather a comprehensive dataset comprising information about used cars, including features such as mileage, brand, model year, condition, and more.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data consistency.
Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features and transform them into a format suitable for modeling.
Model Development: Utilize logistic regression, a powerful supervised learning algorithm, to build the pricing model.
Model Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics to ensure its accuracy and reliability.
Insights Generation: Analyze the model outputs and identify significant factors influencing used car prices.
Recommendations: Provide actionable insights and recommendations based on the analysis findings to guide businesses in devising profitable pricing strategies.
Expected Outcome:
By the end of this project, I anticipate having a well-performing predictive pricing model for used cars, equipped with insights into the factors driving price variations. This model will empower businesses to make informed decisions regarding pricing strategies, ultimately maximizing profitability in the competitive used car market.
